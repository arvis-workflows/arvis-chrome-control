Chrome Control
==============

![Chrome Control](img/banner.png)

A JXA script and an Alfred Workflow for controlling Google Chrome
(Javascript for Automation).

This repository is forked from [chrome-control](https://github.com/bit2pixel/chrome-control)

Usage
-----

Make this file an executable
```sh
chmod +x ./chrome.js
```

Then run: 
```sh
./chrome.js
```


> MacOS will ask you to allow permissions for this tool to control Chrome.  
> Feel free to inspect the code before accepting.

Integration
-----------

You can use `chrome-control` to create fun integrations with your favorite tools (Alfred, vim, vscode, iterm2, ...).

### Chrome Control commands

Chrome Control commands:
  - `tabs`: Lists all tabs
  - `close url <keywords>`: Close tabs with URLs matching these keywords
  - `close title <keywords>`: Close tabs with titles matching these keywords
  - `dedup`: Close duplicate tabs


Commands
--------

### Close duplicate tabs

```sh
./chrome.js dedup
```


### Close all tabs by `titles` containing strings 
> Strings are separated by spaces and `case insensitive`.

```sh
./chrome.js close --title "inbox" "iphone - apple"
```

```sh
./chrome.js close --title inbox iphone
```

### Close all tabs by `URLs` containing strings
> Strings are separated by spaces and `case insensitive`.

```sh
./chrome.js close --url "mail.google" "apple"
```

```sh
./chrome.js close --url google apple
```

### List all open tabs in all Chrome windows

```sh
./chrome.js list
```

The output is `JSON`, so you can pipe it to `jq`.
```sh
./chrome.js list | jq .
```

Returns a struct like this:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "Inbox (1) - <hidden>@gmail.com - Gmail",
      "url": "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox",
      "winIdx": 0,
      "tabIdx": 0,
      "arg": "0,0",
      "subtitle": "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox"
    },
    {
      "title": "iPhone - Apple",
      "url": "https://www.apple.com/iphone/",
      "winIdx": 0,
      "tabIdx": 1,
      "arg": "0,1",
      "subtitle": "https://www.apple.com/iphone/"
    }
  ]
}
```

> `arg` and `subtitle` are used for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) integration.

### Close a specific tab in a specific window

> `Window Index` and `Tab Index` is the `arg` returned by the `list` command.

```js
./chrome.js close 0,13
```


### Focus on a specific tab in a specific window

```js
./chrome.js focus 0,13
```

### Show help

```sh
./chrome.js 
```

### Don't prompt the user

`--yes` flag will cause no questions to be asked to the user. It'll close all tabs straight away.

> Attention: Use this with caution. Make sure you don't have any unsaved work, emails, ... etc.

### Prompt user in Chrome

`--ui` flag will cause the questions to be asked using a Chrome dialog instead of text in command line.

```sh
./chrome.js close --url apple --ui
```
